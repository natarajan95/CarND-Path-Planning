Project:
 In this project we try to define a path made up of (x,y) points that the car will visit sequentially every .02 seconds.

Flow:
A) Start the vehicle from current (middle) lane and rise to the max allwoed speed limit
B) Continue on the same lane.
C) (i)  If we encounter a car before us
		(1) Reduce speed gradually
		(2) Iterate through sensor data of all cars in the vicinity
		(3) Check right lane and left lane to see if we can shift lane and decide on a target lane (left or right)
		(4) If unable to decide a target lane, continue in the same lane with reduced speed and try again in next iteration
		(4) If there are no cars in the target lane in vicinity, shift lane, increase speed and continue
D) (ii) Else Continue

Rubrics Points - Valid Trajectory Criteria:
A) The car is able to drive at least 4.32 miles without incident - Yes

B) The car drives according to the speed limit. - Set a maximum speed of 49.5

C) Max Acceleration and Jerk are not Exceeded. - Total acceleration/deceleration is set at 5 m/s^2 steps ensuring smooth rise/fall in drive speed

D) Car does not have collisions. - Smooth acceleration/deceleration and constant monitoring of environment takes care of this.

E) The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes. - Unless the current lane is obstructed, we do not attempt to lane change

F) The car is able to change lanes - Yes, only when needed to do so and after checking the target lane for clear path to proceed.
